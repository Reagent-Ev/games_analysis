# Games Analysis

Found an interesting dataset on videos games and wanted to do some analysis on it to find some insights in the data.

The original excel file is included as well as the jupyter notebook to clean the data and the final cleaned data file.
You can access the final visualization dashboard i created based on this data on Tableau Public linked [Here](https://public.tableau.com/views/VideoGamesReviewsandSalesAnalysis/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
